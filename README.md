#Project 1: COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL queries to derive valuable insights from datasets spanning from early 2020 to 2023. By leveraging various SQL techniques and functions, the following tasks were accomplished:

Percentage of Population Affected: Analyzed the total number of cases in relation to the population, providing insights into the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19.

Highest Infection Rates: identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population, highlighting regions facing significant challenges.

Daily Death Percentage: utilized common table expressions (CTE), temporary tables, partition by, and views to calculate the daily death percentage across the world, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the evolving situation.

This project serves as a demonstration of SQL proficiency and showcases the ability to extract meaningful insights from extensive COVID-19 datasets

#Project 2: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and organizing Nashville housing data using SQL queries. The objective was to ensure a clear and structured understanding of the entire database. The following tasks were performed to achieve this goal:

Data Cleaning: Implemented SQL queries to clean and remove any inconsistent or erroneous data from the Nashville housing dataset. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and resolving any inconsistencies.

Data Organization: Utilized SQL queries to organize the housing data into logical and meaningful categories. This included grouping properties by location, type, size, and other relevant attributes, facilitating easier analysis and interpretation.

Data Quality Assurance: Implemented validation checks and data quality assurance measures using SQL queries to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the dataset. This involved identifying and handling duplicates, outliers, and other potential data issues.

By executing these SQL queries, the Nashville housing dataset was transformed into a clean, organized, and reliable resource for further analysis and decision-making processes.

This project showcases the ability to leverage SQL for data cleaning, organization, and quality assurance, providing a solid foundation for insightful data analysis in the Nashville housing domain.
